# PPIV
This code is used to calculated the pressure field from the velocity field in fluids, for example, wind tunel or water tunel.
'My_Get_Accelaration_centr_diff_real.m' is used to calculate the â€˜Gradient' of velocity, which is like the acceleration.
After that 'My_omni_directional_init.m' is used to calculate the pressure field. 'Validate_rigid_body.m' is used to test the code. The Pdf in the repository is the idea of this code

This code is used by post-process of PIV data.
